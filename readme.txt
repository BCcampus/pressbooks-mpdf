Pressbooks mPDF

== Description ==

[mPDF](http://www.mpdf1.com/mpdf/index.php) is an open source PHP class that generates PDF files from HTML.
mPDF is also released under a GPLv2 license and made by people other than the authors of this plugin. 

The mPDF class is large and not a development focus for pressbooks.com. Where the mPDF class has previously been a part of the [pressbooks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressbooks), it has now been removed. 
Installing this plugin will restore the previous functionality that open source users have come to expect if the license fee for [PrinceXML](http://www.princexml.com/) is a barrier.  

[Pressbooks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/pressbooks/) is a requirement in order for this plugin to do anything useful.
